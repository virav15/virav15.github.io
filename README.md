# Web-Visualization-Dashboard
The purpose of this project is to create a visualization dashboard website for a previous project (weatherPy) using HTML and CSS. In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which users can navigate between them. These individual pages contain the visualization and their corresponding explanations. The website consist of seven pages:

Landing page: Contains an explanation of the weatherPy project and links to each visualization page
Four visualization pages: Contains a descriptive title, plot/visualization itself, and a brief description of the plot and its significance
Comparison page: Contains all the visualization on the same page so users can easily visually compare the four plots
Data page: Contains a responsive table with data used for the visualizations.
